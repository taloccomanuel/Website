# Changelog Archive — testauthgas1title

Older version sections rotated from [testauthgas1html.changelog.md](testauthgas1html.changelog.md). Full granularity preserved — entries are moved here verbatim when the main changelog exceeds 50 version sections.

## Rotation Logic

Same rotation logic as the repository changelog archive — see [CHANGELOG-archive.md](../../repository-information/CHANGELOG-archive.md) for the full procedure. In brief: count version sections, skip if ≤50, never rotate today's sections, rotate the oldest full date group together.

## [v01.85w] — 2026-03-15 03:36:50 PM EST — v03.75r

### Added
- Interacting with the app (typing, clicking) now triggers an immediate session check — if your session was ended by another device, you see the overlay within seconds instead of waiting for the next automatic check

## [v01.84w] — 2026-03-15 01:22:15 PM EST — v03.74r

### Added
- "Force Heartbeat" button for testing session validity on demand without waiting for the automatic heartbeat interval

## [v01.82w] — 2026-03-15 12:39:33 PM EST — v03.72r

### Added

### Fixed
- Clicking "Sign In" on the session expiry banner now properly reloads the app and resets all timers after re-authentication
- Countdown timers and heartbeat are stopped before starting the sign-in flow so they cannot trigger sign-out mid-authentication

## [v01.75w] — 2026-03-14 10:06:00 PM EST — v03.57r

### Changed
- Session expiry warning now says "interact with the page to stay signed in" instead of prompting to sign in again

## [v01.64w] — 2026-03-14 07:12:06 PM EST — v03.44r

### Fixed
- Fixed three security test false positives: "document.write" and "eval()" tests no longer flag themselves, and clickjacking test correctly reports that frame-ancestors is an HTTP-header-only directive
