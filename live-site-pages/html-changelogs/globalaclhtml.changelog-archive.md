## Rotation Logic

Same rotation logic as the repository changelog archive — see [CHANGELOG-archive.md](../../repository-information/CHANGELOG-archive.md) for the full procedure. In brief: count version sections, skip if ≤50, never rotate today's sections, rotate the oldest full date group together.
