# Changelog Archive — Inventory Management

Older version sections rotated from [inventorymanagementhtml.changelog.md](inventorymanagementhtml.changelog.md). Full granularity preserved — entries are moved here verbatim when the main changelog exceeds 50 version sections.

## Rotation Logic

Same rotation logic as the repository changelog archive — see [CHANGELOG-archive.md](../../repository-information/CHANGELOG-archive.md) for the full procedure. In brief: count version sections, skip if ≤50, never rotate today's sections, rotate the oldest full date group together.

## [v01.29w] — 2026-04-12 03:51:02 PM EST — v10.87r — [SHA unavailable]

### Added
- "New Total" preview below the quantity adjuster shows the projected total in real time when editing an existing item

## [v01.28w] — 2026-04-12 03:07:57 PM EST — v10.86r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed

## [v01.27w] — 2026-04-12 02:55:11 PM EST — v10.85r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed

- The quantity field is labeled "Adjust Quantity" when modifying an existing item

## [v01.26w] — 2026-04-12 12:56:32 PM EST — v10.84r — [SHA unavailable]

## [v01.25w] — 2026-04-11 11:43:01 PM EST — v10.83r — [SHA unavailable]

### Fixed
- Tapping the camera to expand it to full screen now works correctly — previously the camera stayed small when tapped

## [v01.24w] — 2026-04-11 11:32:19 PM EST — v10.82r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- The flashlight, stop camera, and manual entry buttons now appear next to the camera instead of overlaying it — easier to reach and always visible

## [v01.23w] — 2026-04-11 11:11:17 PM EST — v10.81r — [SHA unavailable]

### Added
- You can now scan items rapidly without waiting for each save to complete — scanned items are queued and saved in the background one at a time
- A blue "queued" badge appears showing how many items are waiting to be saved
- Each queued item appears in the table immediately with a "Queued" or "Sending" indicator
- If a save fails, a red notification appears with the item details — remaining items continue saving

## [v01.22w] — 2026-04-12 08:16:30 PM EST — v10.80r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- The Quantity field in the entry form now defaults to `1` for new items (previously it was blank). For existing items it already defaulted to `1` as the delta to add — both contexts are now consistent. You can still type any value or use the − / + buttons to adjust before saving

## [v01.21w] — 2026-04-11 07:49:46 PM EST — v10.77r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- 0 is no longer an option in any of the quantity steppers (the new "Auto add" increment input next to the camera, and the existing − / + buttons in the scan/manual entry form). Pressing − when the value is 1 now jumps straight to -1 (skipping 0), and pressing + when the value is -1 now jumps straight to 1. Typing 0 directly into the field and tabbing away snaps the value back to 1. The previous Auto add behavior where setting 0 silently incremented by 1 is fixed — if the value is somehow 0 when a scan fires, the entry form now opens instead so you can see what's happening

## [v01.20w] — 2026-04-11 07:40:08 PM EST — v10.76r — [SHA unavailable]

### Fixed
- Fixed the new "Auto add" toggle: turning it on now actually bypasses the entry form and immediately adds the configured amount when you scan a known item. The previous version had the toggle and increment input visible but the auto-add path wasn't being reached on real scans, so the entry form kept opening regardless of the toggle state

## [v01.19w] — 2026-04-11 06:53:17 PM EST — v10.75r — [SHA unavailable]

### Added
- New "Auto add" toggle next to the camera scanner on phones (and below the camera on desktop). When the toggle is off, scanning a barcode opens the entry form as before so you can review and confirm the quantity. When the toggle is on, scanning a known item silently adds the configured amount to that item's quantity without opening the form — useful for fast bulk-counting
- New increment input next to the Auto add toggle, with − and + buttons. Set the increment to any positive or negative number (e.g. +1, +2, -1, -2) to control how much each scan adds or subtracts. The value persists across page reloads
- Scanning an unknown barcode (one not yet in the inventory) while Auto add is on will still open the entry form, so you can name the new item before saving it

## [v01.18w] — 2026-04-11 06:04:15 PM EST — v10.73r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- On phones, the camera scanner is now a square preview with the status display sitting beside it instead of stacked underneath, making the layout more compact and leaving room next to the camera for additional controls

## [v01.17w] — 2026-04-11 05:44:20 PM EST — v10.72r — [SHA unavailable]

### Fixed
- Fixed the pencil edit button so it now works the same way as scanning an existing item to change the quantity. Tap the pencil on any row, enter the amount to add or subtract (or use − / +), click Save, and the row's quantity updates correctly

## [v01.16w] — 2026-04-11 05:31:18 PM EST — v10.71r — [SHA unavailable]

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where editing a row via the pencil button and clicking Save did not update the values in the table. Changes now reflect immediately in the table after clicking Save, and the sheet gets updated in the background

## [v01.15w] — 2026-04-11 05:19:50 PM EST — v10.70r — [SHA unavailable]

### Added
- Each row in the inventory table now has an edit button (✏️) next to the delete button. Tapping it opens the same entry form used for scanning/manual entry, pre-filled with that row's current values. The + / − buttons let you adjust the quantity directly, and Save writes the changes back to the sheet. Last User and Last Updated are refreshed automatically when you save

## [v01.14w] — 2026-04-11 05:03:25 PM EST — v10.69r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- Entry form (both manual and scan) no longer shows the Last User and Last Updated fields — these are always filled in automatically, so hiding them removes noise and makes the form quicker to scan. The table still displays both columns as before

## [v01.13w] — 2026-04-11 04:40:42 PM EST — v10.68r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- Manual entry form now has the same − / + quantity adjustment buttons as the scan entry form — both entry screens now look identical, with the only difference being whether the barcode is filled in automatically (scan) or typed in manually

## [v01.12w] — 2026-04-10 01:06:37 PM EST — v10.67r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- Mobile view now shows only Item Name and Quantity columns — Barcode, Last User, and Last Updated are hidden below 600px screen width for easier scanning on phones

## [v01.11w] — 2026-04-10 12:08:01 PM EST — v10.65r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- Inventory table now shows 5 columns in this order: Item Name, Quantity, Barcode, Last User, Last Updated
- Removed the Timestamp column from the inventory table and the scan entry form

## [v01.10w] — 2026-04-10 11:28:11 AM EST — v10.63r — [SHA unavailable]

### Changed
- Redesigned the scanner for phone screens — the camera now shows as a compact strip at the top, leaving room for the inventory list below
- Tap the scanner strip to expand it to fullscreen for tougher scans; tap the × button to collapse it back
- When a scan is detected, the scanner automatically collapses so the inventory list is visible behind the confirmation dialog
- Desktop view is unchanged

## [v01.09w] — 2026-04-09 10:27:54 PM EST — v10.62r — [e3cacef6](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/e3cacef6)

## [v01.08w] — 2026-04-09 09:10:55 PM EST — v10.61r — [32ef533a](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/32ef533a)

### Changed
- Add Row and Entry buttons no longer trigger the on-screen keyboard

## [v01.07w] — 2026-04-09 09:05:22 PM EST — v10.60r — [119f32b0](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/119f32b0)

### Changed
- Tapping the quantity +/− buttons no longer opens the on-screen keyboard

## [v01.06w] — 2026-04-09 09:01:19 PM EST — v10.59r — [24ff1813](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/24ff1813)

### Added

### Fixed
- Fixed scan confirmation not appearing after scanning a barcode

## [v01.03w] — 2026-04-09 07:46:26 PM EST — v10.56r — [cd47e555](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/cd47e555)

### Changed
- Scanning a barcode that already exists now shows current quantity and item name instead of creating a duplicate entry

## [v01.02w] — 2026-04-09 07:08:19 PM EST — v10.55r — [59e9777f](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/59e9777f)

### Fixed
- HTML toggle now correctly includes all inventory interface elements

## [v01.01w] — 2026-04-09 06:46:36 PM EST — v10.53r — [ff59871e](https://github.com/PFCAssociates/pfcassociates/commit/ff59871e)
